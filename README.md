# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This project is a comprehensive implementation of various machine learning models to classify breast cancer using the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). The dataset contains 31 features and a target variable indicating whether the cancer is malignant (M) or benign (B).
